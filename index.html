The aim is to prepare Windows headless Virual Box hsoted by Linux.  
The VirtualBox is headless and does not require any GUI and could be started  
from the script in /etc/init.d directory for any runlevel.  
There is a Windows service running on guest Windows, that receives from hosting Linux  
Windows specific commands and runs them wit redirected output in such a way, that Linux  
wrapper API is able to get all outputs. Linux wrapper API also can receive the return code  
of Windows specific command and return it to make last error in the Windows accessible also  
caller of wrapper API.
